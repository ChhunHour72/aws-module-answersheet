## 📖 What is Cloud Computing?

**Cloud computing** is the **on-demand delivery** of computing power, database storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet with **pay-as-you-go pricing**.

💡 *Think of it like electricity - you only pay for what you use!*

## 🏗️ Cloud Service Models

There are **3 main service models** that define what's managed for you:

| Model | Name | What You Get |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **IaaS** | Infrastructure as a Service | Virtual machines, storage, networks |
| **PaaS** | Platform as a Service | Development platforms, databases, tools |
| **SaaS** | Software as a Service | Ready-to-use applications |

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SaaS   → Use the software          │
│  PaaS   → Build on the platform     │
│  IaaS   → Control the infrastructure│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## 🌐 Cloud Deployment Models

Choose how you want to deploy based on your needs:

### ☁️ **Cloud**
All parts of your application run in the cloud.
- *Best for: New projects, startups, scalable apps*

### 🔗 **Hybrid**
Connect existing on-premises infrastructure with cloud resources.
- *Best for: Gradual migration, specific compliance needs*

### 🏢 **On-Premises (Private Cloud)**
Use virtualization and resource management in your own data center.
- *Best for: Strict regulatory requirements, legacy systems*
